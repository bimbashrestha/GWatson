A GUI wrapper around [Watson](https://github.com/TailorDev/Watson).

Works on OSX and Linux. Will work on Windows too after some small changes. Just haven't gotten around to it.

# Installation 

Clone this repo and inside it run:

```
pip install .
```

Then you can run it using the command:

```
gwatson
```

# Contributing

Python type annotations are helpful. Please use them. I use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) like this before comitting changes to master.

```
mypy --strict gwatson.py
```
